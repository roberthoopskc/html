<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hi. Hello. Howdy. Cowabunga. I’m Robert, a creative beast who makes cool stuff in Kansas City, Missouri. Here’s my story.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;h3&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a child, my favorite place to be was alone in my room, drawing and writing comics. As I progressed through school, my illustration and writing skills made me stand out, and in high school, I discovered theatre. As a creative storyteller and visual artist, theatre appealed to me because it allowed me to mix multiple forms of art- illustration, writing, music, etc- to form one cohesive, narrative creation. So, when it was time to choose where to go to college, I was torn between art school or studying writing/theatre.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;!-insert recent illustrations-&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Initially I chose art school to study illustration. It wasn’t a super great experience: this was 2001, and emerging technologies like digital illustration tablets and DSLR cameras were scoffed at by my professors as fads or too inaccessible to anybody without deep pockets. I left after one semester and took a few months off before returning to college in the fall, studying English at a smaller university. I became involved with their theatre program and switched majors my junior year.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was allowed to flex my creative muscles here, writing and producing my own plays, designing costumes and sets in my sketchbook, and so on. My shows sold out each night and it looked like I had a bright future in the Kansas City theatre world. I graduated with honors, and had a few offers to join high profile productions at big theatre companies in town.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;!-make a college collage-&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;h3&gt;Post College&lt;/h3&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Being raised poor in a blue-collar family, I was urged to find a steady job instead of taking advantage of the connections and momentum gained in college. I got a cushy job working as an audio-visual specialist at a high school, settled down with my fiancé, and let my ambitions die. I dabbled in local indie film acting, and my relaxed job atmosphere allowed me the opportunity to teach myself how to digitally illustrate in Photoshop, but for the most part, I regret my laziness in those years.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;!-insert digital art-&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;h3&gt;Photography and Technology&lt;/h3&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After a few years I was promoted to manage the school’s technology office, where I gained valuable tech skills. At the same time, I resented that I wasn’t working in a more creative role, and I began pursuing an interest in photography. I’d come up with creative concepts in my sketchbooks, and I wanted to bring them to life in front of the lens. I taught myself how to shoot and edit digital photography, and after a few years of this, I won a handful of awards. In 2013, I was named the Best Indie Photographer in Kansas City at the RAW People’s Choice Awards, and in 2016 I was named 2nd in the top 3 Best Photographers for Hire in The Pitch’s Best of KC.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;!-insert photography collage-&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;h3&gt;Digital Marketing, Social Media, and Nonprofit Work&lt;/h3&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despite becoming one of the best photographers in the city, my ingrained blue-collar doubts, along with my wife’s fear that I wouldn’t be able to make it as a freelancer, led me to gravitate to a safer career. I got a job as a creative services coordinator for our school district’s public relations and marketing team, where my photography, graphic design, and writing skills were put to use. I also began producing a lot of video, teaching myself to edit in Premiere Pro. My greatest accomplishment in this role was producing a multimedia campaign that convinced voters to approve a $14 million dollar bond just two years after they’d previously approved another bond and levy. The flagship video created for this series was awarded 1st place by the Missouri School Public Relations Association in 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During my time in these years, I also became motivated to get more civically involved. I felt like I was just taking up space in the world, consuming too much and not producing enough. I began participating in nonprofit benefit events as a featured artist, eventually being welcomed to join my first board of directors. I’ve served on three boards in a Creative Director or Social Media Director capacity. I also participated as a candidate in the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society’s Man &amp; Woman of the Year campaign in 2014.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;h3&gt;Scout City and Career Purgatory&lt;/h3&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was beginning to gain a name for myself as a visual artist and photographer in Kansas City, seeing my work displayed in galleries and sold at pop up events around town. I was frequently asked about putting my designs on t-shirts, and I finally relented in 2015 by establishing my apparel line, Scout City. I had meager success; my designs were carried in high profile shops like Hallmark and Made in KC, and were very popular at local maker fairs including The Westport Art Fair and Strawberry Swing Indie Craft Festivals.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;!-insert scout city collage-&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2016, I’d just been named one of the best photographers in Kansas City and my apparel line was soaring. Rather than jump on these opportunities, my dead-end, low-paying day job in education kept pulling my focus and time away. My wife was still unsupportive of freelancing. I began to feel frustrated in my career; I felt as if I was spinning my wheels in place during the day. Since I couldn’t freelance full time, I resolved to break out of working in education, and set a goal of breaking into the creative or agency world.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;!-award pic of me-&gt;</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;h3&gt;Rude Awakenings&lt;/h3&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Interviewing for a career change was rough. Numerous times, I made final round interviews after months of sneaking around my boss, taking time off of work, studying companies and the roles I applied for, and so on. Every time, after rounds and rounds of interviews, I was picked over for someone who was just a bit more specialized in their area of expertise. It became apparent that my many years of working in education made me a hard sell in the private sector, and that my “jack of all trades” set of creative skills was more of a blessing than a curse. Companies didn’t want a person who could “do it all.” They wanted someone who could do one thing really well and focus on that. I was deeply discouraged. I lost faith in myself and stopped creating art, shut my apparel line down, and sparingly took on new photography clients.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despite lifelong praise of my creative skills, I felt completely unmarketable.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;h3&gt;Learning to Code&lt;/h3&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I ended up taking a job as an account manager at Sprint, which turned into a call center job after a leadership change two weeks in. This was a breaking point for me. I knew I needed a drastic change in my career path.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While working in education, I witnessed the rising trend of teaching young children how to code. I covered many events where children as young as kindergarteners were showcasing their programming skills. I kept mulling this over in my cubicle; the thought of being left in the dust when these little geniuses entered the workforce. I decided to begin learning how to code that summer.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Immediately, I immensely enjoyed learning this new skill. As a visual artist who was familiar with how to assign elements like color using values like hexadecimals, I appreciated the artistry in building a website. It was like getting a glimpse at the man behind the curtain.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;h3&gt;Back to Academia&lt;/h3&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Near the end of the summer I received a call from Park University, where I’d earned my theatre degree. I’d interviewed for as social media manager role in that spring, but like every other interview that year, they went with someone with more specialized experience. However, I kept in touch with their director of marketing, as she was hoping to create a multimedia manager position to have me fill. That didn’t happen unfortunately, but her social media manager was now leaving to become a professional influencer. She offered me the job and I’ve been here since.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a social media manager, I completely refreshed the brand, establishing new guidelines, writing copy with a unique band voice, producing professional photography and videography, and graphic design as a team of one. It’s exhausting. I didn’t like returning to education, but it was a better choice than where I was.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;!- insert instagram comparison -&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’ve managed to learn more valuable skills. I’ve become adept at search engine optimization, working closely with our web team to maintain brand consistency. I’ve become immersed in digital best practices and popular trends, like mobile-first design and the importance of video content over static images. I was also tasked with learning how to fly and shoot with a drone, for which I had to earn a pilot’s license through the FAA. My first drone video produced for my job went viral and was broadcast by numerous regional news stations and The Weather Channel.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;h3&gt;Preparing to Launch&lt;/h3&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’ve been working in social media management for over two years. I’ve regained confidence in my creative skills. I relaunched my apparel brand and used my learning to increase my reach and refine my presence on social media and the web. Still, I’m motivated to grow beyond working in education. This role better prepared me to find a more lucrative career in digital marketing, and when I saw that LaunchCode was starting a new term this fall, I jumped at the chance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have two children now. We’ve been told by two teachers and a doctor that my four-year-old needs to be placed in gifted classes. My one year old is showing signs of the same intelligence. I can’t drag them down by not being able to afford private school. I won’t disservice them by instilling the same blue-collar doubt that has cursed me.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So, here I am. Providing a better future for them is my motivation. Future proofing my career from a tech-ingrained Gen Z for my children’s sake keeps me going. The excitement of grasping code and the artistry involved in doing so has become a passion that compliments the other endeavors in my creative toolbox.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
